## __Project Description__

This project is a portion of my ["CS260 Class at Bristol State University"](http://cisweb.bristolcc.edu/~ik/) in software design. This course has covered all the aspects of the software development and design process, and I became interested in mermaid because it makes nice charts rather easily. I thought that embedding them into html is a simple way to share them, so this package can serve a simple template for to draw upon in the future. The charts themselves are visible under the "visible_on_github" directory".

### __Installation (if you would like to use this as a template)__

1. Ensure you have Clojure installed on your machine. You can follow the official installation guide.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:

3. git clone https://github.com/your-username/elevators-visitors-state-diagrams.git

4. cd root

5. Begin the application using:
    - npm start, which will begin running the application locally over port 3000, which it will link to ine terminal

### __Technologies Used__

- Javascript: Sets up an express server at port 3000 in server.js, and run_mermaid.js contains a function to display mermaid files.

- Mermaid: [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that allows you to create diagrams and flowcharts using plain text. It supports a wide variety of diagram types including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, Gantt charts, and more. Mermaid makes it easy to create and visualize complex diagrams directly within markdown files or web pages.

- HTML & CSS: For formatting of the page and styling of the page respectively.
    - Bootstrap for the image carousel/sliding image component.
